Probe-fed microstrip patch antennas have emerged as a popular choice for 5G applications, particularly at the 4 GHz frequency range, due to their compact size, low profile, and ease of integration with other electronic components. 

These antennas consist of a metallic patch on top of a dielectric substrate, with a 
ground plane on the bottom and a coaxial probe feed connecting directly to the patch through the substrate. 

The probe feeding method offers several advantages, including efficient power transfer, controllable input impedance, and reduced spurious radiation compared to edge-fed designs. When designing a probe-fed microstrip patch antenna for 4 GHz operation, key considerations include substrate selection, patch dimensions, feed point location, and bandwidth enhancement techniques. Proper design can yield antennas with return loss better than -10 dB, bandwidth of 2-5% of the center frequency, gain of 5-8 dBi, and a broadside radiation pattern with a half-power beamwidth of about 60-70 degrees.

These characteristics make probe-fed microstrip patch antennas well-suited for various 5G applications, such as small cell base stations, customer premises equipment (CPE), and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, where compact and efficient antennas are crucial for optimal performance in the sub-6 GHz frequency band.

A probe-fed microstrip patch antenna for 5G applications at 4 GHz typically consists of the following 
components: 

1. Patch: A thin metallic layer on top of the substrate that acts as the radiating element. For a rectangular 
patch, the width and length are calculated based on the desired frequency and substrate properties. 

2. Substrate: A dielectric material that separates the patch from the ground plane. For 4 GHz applications, 
low-loss materials like Rogers RT/Duroid 5880 are often used. 

3. Ground plane: A conductive layer on the bottom of the substrate. 

4. Probe feed: A coaxial cable that connects to the patch through a via in the substrate.


# Antenna Designs: 

1. Design parameters: 

‚Ä¢ Frequency(fo) ‚Äì 4GHz 

‚Ä¢ Relative permittivity of substrate(ùúÄùëü) ‚Äì 4.4 

‚Ä¢ Thickness of substrate(h) ‚Äì 1.6 mm 

# S parameter plot: 

S-parameter plots typically display the magnitude and phase of S-parameters as a function of frequency. 
Common plot types include: 

1. Rectangular plots: Show magnitude (in dB) or phase vs. frequency. 

2. Smith charts: Display complex S-parameters on a polar plot, useful for impedance matching. 

3. Polar plots: Represent magnitude and phase on a single graph. 

S-parameter plots provide insights into: 
- Reflection (S11, S22): Return loss and input/output matching
- Transmission (S21, S12): Insertion loss, gain.

# VSWR parameter plot: 

Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) plots display the ratio of maximum to minimum voltage along a transmission line. VSWR is directly related to the reflection coefficient and S11.

Key features of VSWR plots: 

‚Ä¢ Frequency is on the x-axis, VSWR on the y-axis 

‚Ä¢ Lower VSWR values indicate better impedance matching 

‚Ä¢ Ideal VSWR is 1:1, indicating perfect matching 

‚Ä¢ Commonly used in antenna design and impedance matching applications 

# Gain plot: 

Gain plots show the amplification or attenuation of a signal through a device or system as a function of frequency. For a two-port network, gain is typically represented by S21.Characteristics of gain plots: 


‚Ä¢ Frequency on the x-axis, gain (in dB) on the y-axis 

‚Ä¢ Positive values indicate amplification, negative values indicate attenuation

‚Ä¢ Often include markers to highlight specific frequency points of interest

‚Ä¢ Can reveal the bandwidth and flatness of amplifiers or filters 


 
# Conclusion: 

Probe-fed microstrip patch antennas at 4 GHz provide a versatile and efficient solution for modern wireless communication systems. Their compact size, ease of fabrication, and good performance characteristics make them ideal for various applications, especially in the rapidly growing field of 5G technology.

While they may have some limitations in bandwidth, techniques such as stacked patch configurations can be employed to overcome these challenges[3]. As wireless technologies continue to evolve, these antennas are likely to play a crucial role in enabling high-speed, reliable communications across a wide range of devices and systems.
